## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about media querys.

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn about other ways to use media querys and apply the correct resolutions.
